            A new website
        </h3>

        <p>
            First of all guys, I wish to really thank you about your interest in these letters! <br>
            I'm very proud of this project and of you being the very first audience.  
        </p>

        <p>
             <u>I think it is time to move on the next step</u> (this one is in top 5 for scariest sentence someone ever said to you). BUT, this is not about your failed relationships... 
        </p>     

        <p>    
            In fact, I'm working on a website to store all the past and future letters. On the website all the letters will be sorted by date. Plus, there will be a special link to a google form where you will be able to subscribe or unsubscribe. <br>
            Yes, if you got tired of receiving these mails you could unsubscribe from them... And that will be totally ok! I will still be forever thankful to you 🫶🏻
        </p>

        

        <p> 
            The website will be online starting from next week. I will be sending it to you together with the next mail. It can be a nice way to promote these letters! You can just send the subscribe link to that friend you know he/she might like them 😇
        </p>

        <p>
            That is all about the updates. We can go now to the movie and song picks 😍

            🎬 Weekly Movie
        </h3>

            <p>
                For this week's movie pick, I have chosen <b>Home Alone</b> directed by <b>Chris Columbus</b>.
            </p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artalink7/letter-assets/main/kevin.png"

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:12px; margin-top:8px;">
               Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) shops groceries
            </p>

        <p>
            Released in 1990, <b>Home Alone</b> is one of the most famous christmas movies. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            We all know the plot, right? I will gloss over it and give some of the reasons I absolutely love this movie. 
        </p>

        <p>
            - <u>Details and decorations</u>. The scenography departement did a tremendous job with an incredible set design. All the rooms in house McCallister are just memorable. There's the dining room where they wet all the passports, the basement with the haunting laundry machine, the third floor bedroom where Kevin shares the bed with his cousin Fuller. <br>
            My favourite one is Buzz's room, with lots of decorations from the 80s'. 
        </p>

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artalink7/letter-assets/main/Buzzroom.png"

                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:350px; border-radius:6px;">
            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:12px; margin-top:8px;">
               Kevin trying to climb up the shelves in his brother (Buzz)'s room and stealing some of his savings.
            </p>

        <p>
            - <u>Funny lines</u>. There are a huge number of funny lines in the movie that live rent-free in my head. Here's some of my favourite 😍
        </p>

        <p>
            - <u>Screams</u>. Watching this movie I realized that looking at people being hurt is quite enjoyable! In my life I rarely laugh as hard as when I saw Marv (one of the two robbers) screaming in pain. One of my favourite sequence is the one when he steps on a nail.

        <p>
        and finally...
        </p>

        <p> 
        - <u> Music</u>. An incredible score composed by John Williams. Yet another masterpiece from the maestro. Not overselling it if I say one of the best soundtrack among 90s movies...
        </p>
            
        </div>

    <p>
        The leader of the robbers duo in <b>Home Alone</b> is Harry, played by <b>Joe Pesci</b>. What an incredible actor he is... Do you know he is also a great singer? Ready for the song pick...🥁

        <p>
            Joe Pesci is mostly famous for his gangster roles in hollywood movies. I think his most memorable role is GoodFellas' Tommy DeVito (I already talked about this movie in a previous letter). 
        </p>

        <p>
            It was a month ago I discover his works in music. With great surprise I found out Joe is also a talented singer! 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Pesci... Still Singing</b> is a record containing covers of famous standard-jazz tracks. A tribute to famous jazz songs from Joe Pesci and his band. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Joe has quite a particular voice, he gives the songs an interesting flavour. My favourite from the album is <b>They Say That Falling In Love is Wonderful</b>. <br>
            Originally, the song was composed for a musical aired in the early fifties. It slowly became a standard, with more and more artists re-intepreting the song. <br>
            I think most of the people of my age know this song from the movie Spiderman 3. Indeed, the song is sung by Kirsten Dunst in the opening act of the movie.  
        </p>

            I hope you will enjoy it 🙃
