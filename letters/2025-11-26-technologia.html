            The technology mismatch
        </h3>

        <p>
            I realized I haven't talked about a single sci-fi movie yet. What a shame, Giuliano. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The term science-fiction was (probably) first used to credit Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. <br>
            No, I'm not going to talk about the new Netflix movie. I'm sorry Netflix, starring Mia Goth is not enough to convince me to watch your productions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Sci-fi is a relatively new literature genre. However, it is one of the oldest (if not <u>the</u> oldest) movie genre! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the sci-fi movies are set in the future. Naturally, with old sci-fi movies, it can happen that the time when the movie is set is comparable with our present-day time. <br>
            It is interesting to compare the technolgy portraited in the movies vs the one we created for real. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, movies never got it right... <br>
            I refer to it as the <span style="font-weight:700;">technology mismatch</span> or the <span style="font-weight:700;">Back to the Future catastrophy</span>

                Back to The Future Part II. Released in 1989, the movie has some scenes set in the future year 2015. We are already in 2025, where is my freaking hoverboard??

        IMO, there are two key aspects of our life that these old sci-fi movies failed to predict: internet and the advent of the digital era. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Even the most advanced objects in these movies are chunky, full-of-buttons, analogic devices. Take spaceships as an example. In <b>Alien</b>, the crew members travel inside the Nostromo, a spaceship capable of interplanetary missions... Yet using some cathode ray tube screens.

        <p>
            Actually, there is <u>one</u> technology we are now using in our life and that's also portraited in these movies. It is artificial intelligence. 
        </p>

               <b>2001: A space odissey. </b> HAL 9000 is the red-eye and superintelligent computer guiding the crew through its mission. <br><u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE">"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"</a></u>. 
        
            </p>
        <p>
        HAL 9000 is probably the most famous example of A.I. in movies and , to me, it is also the scariest 😱. The reason is that HAL decides to annihilate humans as soon as he understands he will be shut down. You have not a friend in me, HAL. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Almost every sci-fi movie has it's own A.I. character in it! 
        </p>
        <p>
        ... And not only sci-fi movies. In Iron Man, Tony Stark interacts with his multi-functional machines in a similiar way we do with LLMs.

            🎬 Weekly Movie
        </h3>

            <p>
                For this week's movie pick, I have chosen <b>Her</b> directed by <b>Spike Jonze</b>.
            </p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artalink7/letter-assets/main/her.png"
                alt="her."
                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:400px; border-radius:6px;">
            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:12px; margin-top:8px;">
               Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and Amy (Amy Adams)
            </p>

        <p>
            <b>Her</b> was released in 2013, some year before the A.I. fever. However, the movie is very current.
        </p>

        <p>
            The protagonist is Theodore, a writer. He has to deal with a painful breakup and it seems he can't find the right support from the people around him. 
            He finds comfort in playing video games, staying home, avoiding social contacts as much as possible. <br>
            The situation changes when Theodore installs a new intelligent OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), in his computer. Samantha is charming and sweet (not quite like HAL 9000). The two of them communicate at any time through a special earphone Theodore wears all day long. They start a "real" relationship. <br>
            The relationship will evolve more and more, until Theodore starts questioning himself about what he <i>really</i> wants.
        </p>

        <p>
            What does Theodore want? Probably he wants what we all want, just being happy I guess 😅 to do so we need to bond with people 🫂 and sometime it requires arguing, fighting, dealing with the irrational part of our personality. A.I. can't really help with that 😕
        </p>

        <p>
            The plot is quite simple, no particular action or twists. What catches the eyes is a beautiful color palette tilted towards red, orange and pink.
        </p>   

        <p>
            Big up also for Scarlett Johansson. We only hear her voice, still it seems she really is in the scene.

            This is an italian song. Sorry for the non-italian readers... The title means "I fell in love with an AI". However, I'm confident you can still enjoy it!
        </p>

        <p>
            Beside the lyrics, I kinda like the dreamy vapor-wave feeling of the song... Especially in the chorus.
