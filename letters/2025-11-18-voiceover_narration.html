        The problem with voiceover narration
      </h3>

      <p>
        Over the past days I decided that for this letter I would write about about a specific element in movies. IMO, this element is, usually, a big red flag 🚩.
      </p>

      <p>I'm talking about the <u> voiceover narration</u>.</p>

      <p>
        The role of a background / off-screen narrator is not always well defined. He (or she) should give some information that are not directly staged from the screenplay. <br>
        The narrator should "walk" the spectator through the movie. The goal is to make sure that anyone who's watching the movie is not missing any important information.
      </p>

      <p>Why this should be a problem?</p>

          The Office, episode 14 season 2. We see Jim (John Krasinski) listening to Pam's (Jenna Fisher) voicemail. The act of listening is actually off-screen. We here Pam's voice while jim is already leaving the office. <br>
          An incredible sequence: no narrators, no dialogues, only images edited perfectly and we get all the information we need...

        The problem is when the narrator fills the lack of a proper
        <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mise-en-scène</a></u>!
      </p>

        Movies are about images. If the author (could be the director or anyone in the production) is not able to communicate through images and he needs a background narrator in order to explain what is happening on-screen, well that is kind of a bad direction... 😕
      </p>

      <p>
        The most obnoxious example of this kind of "bad direction" that comes to my mind is actually not from a movie, but from a tv show. <i>Money Heist</i> (La casa de papel, the original title).
      </p>

      <p>
        I assume you all know the plot of this crap. It is basically a latino america soap opera with a bunch of idiots trying to rob the Royal Mint of Spain. <br>
        During the show we are constantly updated by this external narrator (I think it was a woman in the first season) about what is happening, what the characters are thinking, what they are doing, what they are going to do etc... I mean... don't <u>tell</u> me, <u>show</u> it to me!!
      </p>

      <p>
        To conclude, my opinion is that this narrator-trick is often used by authors that are just total unqualified for the job.
