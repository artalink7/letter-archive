        ... The unexpected connection
    </h3>
        <p> On july 22nd, Ozzy Osbourne passed away. If you ever approached heavy metal music, you already know Ozzy had a topical influence on the genre. <br>
            His career was quite long. He started singing with Black Sabbath at the end of the sixties, and his last concert was just 2 weeks before his death.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Black Sabbath's first album (titled <i> Black Sabbath</i> and containing the title track <i>Black Sabbath </i>... I mean, wtf?) did not gain immediate success and the general critics were quite negative. <br>
            This was mainly due to the gloomy atmosphere and dark lyrics in their compositions. Allusions to occultism and satanic cult are <del> definitely not</del> hidden in the songs. On top of that, the unusual album cover contributed to create a curious goth aesthetic. 
        </p>

                 <br> Apparently they pick the name from the italian movie "I tre volti della paura", distributed in the U.K. as "Black Sabbath"
            </p>

        <p>
        After some disagreement with the band (late 70s), Ozzy left Black Sabbath and started his own solo project. However, he kept the same aesthetic and, somehow, declared himself as "The Prince of Darkness".

            <i>Blizzard of Ozz </i> was the first album born from Ozzy's project and it was released in 1980. Some of the most famous Ozzy's songs are from this album. <br>
            One of them is called <i>Mr. Crowley</i>.
        </p>

            style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:100%; max-width:300px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                "Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?"
            </p>
        <p> 
            Who was Mr. Crowley? <br>
            Born in 1875, Aleister Crowley was one of the most famous occultist of the 20th century. He created a religion called Thelema and joined a number of esoteric covenants. He was also into alpinism and took part in some expeditions in south america and India. <br>
            His insta bio would say something like "Founder of Thelema - in love with nature - ☯️ ⛰" 
        </p>

        <p>
            After first world war, Mr. Crowley decided to make Cefalù (a little town close to Palermo, Sicily) his permanent residence. He established himself and some of his esoteric-like friends in a villa close to the town. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why am I telling you this? <br>
            Well, some time before Ozzy's death I was reading a collection of stories written by sicilian author <i>Leonardo Sciascia</i>, called <i>Il mare colore del vino </i>...
        </p>

        <p>
            The stories are set in Sicily between the 19th and the 20th century and the author combine fictitious and real facts. 
            One of the stories is indeed about the infamous Mr. Crowley. <br>
            Through the story we come to know that the people from Cefalù did not support the presence of Crowley's cult in the town... How could we not see that coming really??
        </p>

            style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:100%; max-width:300px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Ruins of the cult house. Cefalù.
            </p>
        <p>
            Apparently, there wasn't any real scandal. Crowley and his friends were used to walk naked around the house and probably had some wild animals among them... Unaccceptable for Cefalunians. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The twist came with the intervention of the Dux of Italy himself, Benito Mussolini. He had a mail correspondence with Cefalu's police officers because he wanted to know everything about Crowley. The Dux probably suspected Crowley to by a spy from England. <br>
            How the story ended? Well, Crowley was expelled from italy by Mussolini himself. Dux authority bitches.

                🎬 Weekly Movie
            </h3>

            <p>
                For this week's movie pick, I have chosen <b>The Ninth Gate</b> directed by <b>Roman Polanski</b>.
            </p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artalink7/letter-assets/main/ninth_gate.png"

                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:500px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Balkan (Frank Langella) and Corso (Johnny Depp) inspecting a mysterious book. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Polanski is probably my favourite director. 
                He was one of the first to set horror movies at present times. Of course, Rosemary's baby is his true horror-masterpiece. But, come one, picking Rosemary's baby was too easy.                      
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>The Ninth Gate</b> is a horror-thriller movie released in 1999. The protagonist is Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a book hunter. His job consist in acquiring old, prestigious versions of famous books and reselling them to private collectors.
            </p>
            <p>    
                The story is about an investigation concerning a particular book called The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows. It's said the book is somehow connected to the cult of Satan. 
                Because of this, Dean will meet lots of dangerous and weird people during his quest. I'm talking about Aleister Crowley-type-of weirdos.
            </p>

            <p>
                While watching the movie, what fascinated me the most is the real, physical attraction towards the rare books. If hard-cover books are your kink, that's your go-to movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a maniacal attention to details. Every set is extremely well designed. All the sequences in the libraries are amazing.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Although being classified as a "horror" movie, I would suggest to watch the movie also to people who usually don't like horror. Nowdays we would say it is more of a thriller than a horror. No jump scares, but a lot of tension 👍🏻

            <p> What a song guys... It starts with an iconic keyboard solo that sets the mood right away. 
            But the real virtuoso here is guitar-legend Randy Rhoads who, unfortunately, died when he was only 25 years old. Only one year after working on this same album.
