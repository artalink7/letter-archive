            I'm sure you noticed the quote from Alfred Hitchcock in the box at the beggining of the letter (It was there also in the previous letter). The quote is taken from a record containing tense, classical music introduced by Hitchcock himself.

        <p>    
            Fun fact: in 2020, Eminem published an album called "Music To Be Murdered By", a direct citation of Hitchcock's record. The album is themed around horror and fear. At least that was Shady's intention 😅 <br>
            IMO, <i>Darkness</i> is the only song worth mentioning in Eminem's album 👌🏻😉 <br>
            So let's just talk about this hit. Actually, a little introduction might be needed for hip-hop newcomers...
        </p>
        <p>    
            The instrumental part of the first hip-hop songs (early 80s) was sampled from famous records. That is because producers are (usually) not musicians, but, like tailors, they are able to cut out the bass and drum lines from a specific song, so that eventually one can sing/rap on that sample. 
        </p>

            </p>

        <p>    
        The most sampled records in old school hip-hop come from blues-y/jazz-y albums, like the ones from James Brown. <br>
        The reason behind this type of choice is that the funky groove of the sample, along with the "flow" of the rapper, gives more rhythm to the song, and people might be more efficiently engaged on the dance-floor.
        </p>

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Mighty Mike C, from the Harlem crew "Fearless 4". In this very moment he was quite annoyed by a tourist asking him a selfie after only 15-20 questions about hip hop culture.
            </p> 
        <p>
            Nowadays, several samples are used for producing hip-hop songs, and producers even compose some lines with digital tools (not always with the best results though). But you got the idea and the main goal...
        </p>

        <p>    
            Having said that, how surprising and interesting that <b>Darkness</b>' producers used the notes from <i><u> The Sound of Silence</i></u> by <i>Simon & Garfunkel</i>. Quite an atypical choice for a hip-hop song, isn't it? 
        </p>

        <p> In this song, Eminem opens about gun violence in the US. The way he does it is very particular.
        </p>

        <p>
            The song describes two guys, a singer (Eminem himself, presumebly) and a mass shooter. Both of them are just about to perform their "show".
            Eminem wisely alternates the POV of the two characters, finding some common grounds and shared feelings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some dissonant emotions we have here: at 3'15'' we can hear the shooter taking action, firing on people, while the instrumental part touches the happy notes from the Sound of Silence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The change of perspectives and the POVs ping-pong between different characters remind of old Eminem's song, with <i>Guilty Conscience</i> being the most notable example.

                🎬 Weekly Movie
            </h3>

            <p>
                For this week's movie pick, I have chosen <b>Carrie</b> directed by <b>Brian De Palma</b>.
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/artalink7/letter-assets/refs/heads/main/carrie_poster.jpg"
                alt="Carrie movie poster"
                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:400px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Movie poster: before and after the prom. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Carrie</b>, or as I like to call it <i> "The happy-ending Cindarella"</i>, was released in 1976. The story is adapted from Stephen King's omonymous book. 
            </p>

            <p> Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a teenage girl living with her religious-psychopath mother and experiencing some weird telekinetic powers. <br>
                Whenever Carrie has <i>unholy</i> thoughts, her mother forces her to pray for hours and hours, while keeping her imprisoned in a sort of praying cellar / harry-potter-style small closet. 
            </p>

                alt="Carrie first period"
                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:400px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Carrie and her mother Margareth (Piper Laurie). 
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the main themes in the movie is indeed sexuality. Lot of nakedness is shown and we can perceive Carrie's tension in exploring her desires while being respectful to her fanatic mother. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As in most of american movies with teenaged protagonists, everything is centered around the annual prom. Kind of like Cindarella, Carrie will undergo some trouble to go the prom and will eventually find her prince. <br>
                However, a dramatic and unexpected turn of events will make things way more interesting than a classic Cindarella story. 
            </p>

                alt="Carrie first period"
                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:400px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Close-up on Carrie's eyes. Frequent shot in the movie. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Red is the absolute color of the movie. <br>
                In the opening act, we see Carrie dealing with her first period inside the school's restroom: she doesn't really know what is happening (the mother never talked about it as she hoped her daughter could remain "pure") and, sadly, all of her school friends makes fun of her.<br>
                At the end of the movie... Well I'm not going to spoil you, but from the movie poster you might guess there will be some kind of blood too...
            </p>

                style="display:block; margin: 10px auto; width:100%; max-width:400px; border-radius:8px;">

            <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; font-size:10px; margin-top:8px;">
                Carrie dealing with her first period. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Guys, I know violent, horror movies are not that easy to watch for some of us... But... this is a truly masterpiece and, especially the ending sequence, when Carrie finally confronts her mother, is pure cinematic art.
